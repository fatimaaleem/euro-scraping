About 125 square kilometres of greenery was reduced to ashes in the mountainous Limassol region, according to data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) WorldCover Programme.
Roughly 50% of the total burnt area is grassland, 31% hardwood vegetation, 16% tree cover and 1.3% residential.
The wildfires claimed the lives of two people, a 77-year-old woman and her 84-year-old husband, who were found charred to death in their car. They had become trapped by the blaze after trying to escape their home in the village of Monagri.
Two people had been reported missing, local authorities are investigating whether the missing persons correspond with the couple found in their car.
Meanwhile, seven other people are receiving treatment in state hospitals, two of whom were seriously injured but are now in stable condition. Five others are expected to be discharged soon.
Ten countries responded to Cyprus' request for international assistance to help extinguish the fire, Agriculture Minister Maria Panagiotou said, including Jordan, Israel and Spain, which sent aircraft on Thursday.
Greece is additionally sending 26 forestry workers who are specialised in handling resurgent fires.
Meanwhile, 17 areas remain without power as the fire burned much of the electricity infrastructure. As for civilian infrastructure, 43 houses were completely burnt down while another 29 were severely damaged.
The Cypriot government announced that it will cover 100% of the damage to the properties of the affected people."
https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/07/30/mercedes-predicts-360mn-hit-from-us-tariff-turmoil-and-china-slowdown,Mercedes predicts €360 million hit from US tariff turmoil and China slowdown,N/A,2025-07-30 13:49:43 +02:00,"US tariffs will knock over €360 million off the bottom line for German carmaking powerhouse Mercedes-Benz, with the company predicting 2025 sales well below last year's total.
According to an earnings update published on Wednesday, second-quarter profits have already fallen 10% compared to last year and are expected to drop further by the end of 2025. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and earnings per share have both fallen by a staggering 68%.
Quarterly sales in China — normally Mercedes’ biggest market — also fell nearly 20 % year-on-year as domestic electric car brands got cheaper and more popular.
To soften the hit, Mercedes plans to lean even harder on its top end models and keep costs tight. In other words, it hopes that bigger margins on luxury vehicles will offset the smaller number of cars it expects to sell.
“Mercedes-Benz Group now sees Group revenue significantly below the prior-year level based on lower sales expected at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans,” the company said in a statement.
For most of this year, European-made cars were imported into the US at a tariff of 27.5%, but after the most recent deal struck between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump, they will be imported at 15% starting on Friday.
Europe’s automobile sector directly and indirectly employs a whopping 13.8 million people, providing one in every 16 EU jobs. This makes it the backbone for a large share of household incomes across the bloc, especially in the regions where auto manufacturing hubs are located.
Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said the firm would have to navigate the altered political environment in the near future by selling more luxury cars and investing in innovation.
“We’re adapting to new geopolitical realities by using our global production footprint intelligently and by executing our Next Level Performance programme, which goes beyond efficiency measures, to increase the resilience of our company,” CEO Ola Källenius said in a statement.
Specifically, the mid-year report highlighted the pivot to research and development (R&D) to create new products and technologies.
Carmakers pour about €73 billion annually into R&D, more than any other private sector in Europe. Their breakthroughs then often spill into other sectors, such as batteries, robotics and AI.
“The best response is to stay on course to deliver desirable and intelligent products, while keeping a tight grip on costs,” Källenius continued.
Mercedes cars have a strong brand identity and loyalty among consumers who were drawn to their robust engines and high-end, sleek designs, citing reliability and durability.
The company is a top-five player in the global carmaker ranking in terms of revenue, along with two other German companies, Volkswagen and BMW. In the luxury market, it ranks second globally behind BMW.
Motor-vehicle ownership taxes alone inject roughly €428bn a year into EU treasuries, a revenue stream that is critical for public services and larger than the entire annual EU budget."

Warnings are in place in the US state of Alaska.
It is one of thestrongest earthquakesrecorded in modern history.
Japan has ordered nearly 2 million people to evacuate, warning that tsunami waves could continue for more than a day. The highest wave recorded so far has been 1.3 metres, but authorities say they could reach as high as 3 metres.
Tsunami alerts of varying levels have also been issued across many Pacific islands, parts of China, Indonesia, New Zealand, Peru, Mexico and the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador.
The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for 15 countries. Travellers are being warned to follow the advice of local authorities and watch for updates if they are in a place where an alert has been issued.
Tsunamiwaves have reached Hawaii, with a 1.2 metre swell recorded off Oahu. A 1.74 metre has been recorded at Kahului, Maui, while one of 1.5 metres was recorded in Hilo.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green has asked people to follow evacuation orders and stay calm.
The tsunami warning has since been downgraded, and evacuees have been permitted to return home.
A 1.3 metre wave has reached Japan's northern Iwate prefecture, according to the country's weather agency, with others showing up in the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures.
The tsunami has also hit the coast of California, according to the US National Weather Service.
It has reached the shore in Arena Cove and Monterey in the north of the state, and is making its way further south, the service adds.
In Indonesia, residents and tourists in Papua, North Sulawesi, North Maluku and Gorontalo have been advised not to approach coastal areas.
Ferries connecting Hokkaido and Aomori on the northern tip of Japan’s Honshu island were suspended, as well as those connecting Tokyo and nearby islands.
Some local train operations have been suspended or delayed as well, according to operators.
Sendai airport says its runway has been temporarily closed with two domestic flights, one from Fukuoka and another from Osaka, diverted to other airports.
Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways have cancelled all flights to Sendai airport.
Hundreds of delays have been recorded at other Japanese airports including Narita International, Tokyo International (Haneda), Kansai International and Fukuoka.
Several flights have already been diverted away from Hawaii followingtsunamiwarnings, according to FlightRadar24. That includes some that had already departed from Los Angeles, Vancouver, San Francisco, and San Diego.
Honolulu Airport is not closed but is advising travellers to check directly with their airline for the most up-to-date flight status and travel advisories.
Some arrivals scheduled for this afternoon have been cancelled, including an American Airlines flight from Dallas-Fort Worth, United Airlines from San Francisco, and Delta Air Lines from Seattle and Los Angeles.
Cancelled departures this afternoon include a Delta Air Lines flight to Minneapolis, American Airlines to Dallas-Fort Worth, and United Airlines to Houston and Denver.
Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have suspended services to, from or within the Hawaiian islands. As a safety precaution, Alaska Airlines said that flights en route to Hawaii are returning to the mainland or diverting as needed.
""Guests with travel to, from or within the Hawaiian Islands should check the status of their flight before heading to the airport. We are monitoring airport conditions with government agencies and could see operational impacts,"" the airline said in a statement.
It added that a waiver is in place to allow passengers flexibility to adjust their travel plans.
The US Coast Guard has ordered all commercial vessels to evacuate Hawaiian ports, with all harbours closed to incoming traffic.
Norwegian Cruise Line's Pride of America ship has been forced to depart from Hilo harbour in Hawaii around two and a half hours ahead of schedule.
Passengers received alerts reading, “Due to a tsunami warning issued by the State of Hawaii, Pride of America will be departing Hilo immediately as directed by the Department of Transportation.”
“If you’re not in the vicinity of the port, seek higher ground and follow the direction of the local authorities for your safety.”
Many passengers who were out on excursions, as well as crew, were not able to get back to the ship before it left the port, leaving them stranded.
Oceania Cruises’ Oceania Regatta also reportedly executed an early departure Kailua-Kona port, according to the website Cruise Hive.
A ship in deeper waters will barely notice a tsunami travelling below it, and so it is standard procedure for vessels to head away from the port when a tsunami is likely to hit."

High-level representatives gathered in New York on Monday at an International conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, at the United Nations Headquarters.
The United Nations (UN) conference, which was postponed from June and scaled down from world leaders to ministers, established eight high-level working groups to offer proposals on a broad range of topics with regards to the two-state solution.
It resulted in a seven-page declaration, called the ""New York Declaration,"" which sets out a phased plan that urges countries to recognise the state of Palestine, calls for the disarmament of Hamas and envisions the Palestinian Authority governing.
""In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,"" the declaration read.
The declaration also supports the deployment of a “a temporary international stabilisation mission” under the UN Security Council to protect Palestinians, oversee the transfer of administration to the Palestinian Authority, and monitor the ceasefire.
The text condemns the deadly 7 October attack by Hamas, in which the militant group killed about 1,200 people, and took about 250 people hostage. Some 50 of who are still being held. It marks the first condemnation by Arab nations of Hamas.
It also condemns Israel's military offensive in Gaza, in which it killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, and its ""siege and starvation, which have produced a devastating humanitarian catastrophe.""
Co-chairs France and Saudi Arabia urged all 193 UN member states to support the document before the start of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly set to take place mid-September.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and has dismissed the meeting, citing both nationalistic and security concern. The United States, a key ally of Israel, also boycott the event.
France and the United Kingdom have previously expressed their intention to recognise the state of Palestine, which would align them with the 147 UN member states that have already done so.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last week that it would recognise Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly in September, which would make them the first G7 country and permanent member of the UN Security Council to do so.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that Britain would recognise the state of Palestine before September's meeting if Israel did not agree to a ceasefire and a long-term peace process in the upcoming eight weeks."

Waves of more than 1.22 metres were recorded by domestic media at Kuji port in the northern Iwate Prefecture, with video footage showing water swelling.
Authorities said that a tsunami as high as 60 centimetres had been detected as swell moved south along the Pacific coast from Hokkaido to Tokyo Bay. Officials warned that larger waves could still come.
Local media reported one death — a woman in her 50s who died as her car fell over a cliff when heading to an evacuation site in the city of Kumano, and one minor injury in the Hokkaido prefecture.
Japan's Meteorological Agency later lowered its tsunami alert to an advisory on the Pacific coast south of Fukushima. The warnings for the belt from the eastern Ibaraki region down to the southern Wakayama region have been downgraded to ""advisories,"" the country's weather agency said on its website.
The alert is still in place further north in the country.
Japanese authorities warned the nearly 2 million residents asked to evacuate that they might not be able to return home by the day's end.
Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat.
The quake overnight on Wednesday triggered tsunami waves and warnings across the Pacific, including parts of Hawaii, North, Central and South America and the Pacific islands."

The blast occurred in Suphan Buri province, about 95 kilometres northwest of Bangkok in the heart of the country’s central rice-growing region.
The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
The Samerkun Suphan Buri Rescue Foundation reported nine deaths and said two people were taken to hospital in critical condition.
The provincial government's public relations department said one person had been injured. The number of people missing was not immediately clear.
Police Senior Sergeant Major Pinyo Chanmanee said the explosion took place in a building used to produce fireworks. It was not clear if it was licensed to do so.
Video and photographs from the scene showed shattered wooden buildings in green rice fields.
A similar incident in the same area in January 2024 killed around 20 people.
In July 2023, a large explosion at a fireworks warehouse in southern Thailand killed at least 10 and wounded more than 100, according to officials."
https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/07/29/metas-new-wristband-allows-you-to-type-without-touching-a-screen-heres-how-the-ai-device-w,Meta’s new wristband allows you to type without touching a screen. Here’s how the AI device works,N/A,2025-07-29 14:31:49 +02:00,"Imagine sending a text or playing a game without lifting a finger. Or at least, without moving it very much.
This wristband, developed by Meta’s researchers, might just make that real.
The team recently published a study on a new wrist-worn device that turns the slightest muscle twitches into commands that a computer can understand.
The “neuromotor wristband” is designed to capture the intention behind the movement, even if the user’s hand isn’t touching a screen or surface.
It can detect and decode electrical signals produced by forearm muscles using artificial intelligence (AI).
In a video demonstration, a user writes the words “hello world” in mid-air, and a visualisation of the corresponding text appears alongside.
Meta also showed how people can move a cursor around a screen and play games using only finger taps or tiny hand motions.
""It really is a somewhat breathtaking set of discoveries we have here,” Thomas Reardon, vice president of research at Meta Reality Labs, said in a company-provided video explanation.
Most brain machine interfaces available todayrequire surgery.
Meanwhile, the electrodes in the wristband pick up signals sent from the brain to the muscles, instead of putting the sensors directly in the brain by drilling into the skull.
“We decided to take a different approach and record from the natural output of the brain. We don't need to go into your body to listen to [it]. We can do that from the side of the body,"" Reardon said.
The wrist and forearm are packed with muscles that control hand and finger movements.
These neuromuscular signals are processed in real time and send commands to computers via Bluetooth.
The Meta team collected training data from thousands of participants to build an AI that works for users with different movement styles.
The team says the wristband will be able to help a wide spectrum of users, from individuals with disabilities to everyday users.
""We took the approach of saying, how would we build something such that it just worked right out of the box with eight billion people?” Reardon said.
“This research that we're publishing demonstrates that there are some inherent, what we call scaling laws, that allow us to build a general model for really all of civilisation, such that people can put on a band and start using their brain directly,” Reardon added.
“They elect those signals from their brain in a general way to control a computer”.
Patrick Kaifosh, director of research science at Meta Reality Labs, said he expects “the technology to go a great deal farther”.
“What you've seen is these scaling curves continue as you get more people, more participants, data, it gets better and better,"" he added.
Meta says it hopes that the study offers a blueprint to the broader scientific community “to create neuromotor interfaces of their own,” according to astatement.
It has recently released over 100 hours of muscle signal data from more than 300 participants.

https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/30/trump-says-epstein-stole-young-female-staff-from-his-mar-a-lago-resort,Trump says Epstein 'stole' young female staff from his Mar-a-Lago resort,N/A,2025-07-30 10:45:25 +02:00,"US President Donald Trump has said that the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ""stole"" young women who worked at his Mar-a-Lago resort.
One of the women was Virginia Giuffre, among Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday while returning from a trip to Scotland.
Trump's comments expanded on remarks he had made a day earlier, when he said he had banned Epstein from his private club in Florida two decades ago because his one-time friend ""stole people that worked for me"".
The president has become increasingly rattled by questions about the pair's relationship amid an outcry over his administration's refusal to release more records about the government's sex-trafficking investigation into Epstein after promises of transparency.
Conspiracy theories have been rife among parts of Trump's MAGA base, and he has tried to downplay or deflect attention and questions into the Epstein case.
Trump has expressed frustration that people are still talking about it six years after Epstein died by suicide in prison while awaiting trial, criticised some of his supporters, and repeatedly called the issue a ""hoax"".
His latest comments came as lawyers for Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell — who was convicted of helping him sexually abuse underage girls — said that she is willing to testify before Congress if she is granted immunity and other protections.
While speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he was upset that Epstein was ""taking people who worked for me"". The women, he said, were ""taken out of the spa, hired by (Epstein) — in other words, gone"".
""I said, listen, we don’t want you taking our people,"" Trump said. When it happened again, the president said he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.
Last week, the White House said the president had cut ties with his former friend because he regarded him as a ""creep"".
Asked by reporters if Giuffre was one of the employees poached by Epstein, Trump hesitated but then said, ""he stole her"".
Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year. She had alleged that Maxwell spotted her working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, when she was a teenager, and hired her as Epstein’s masseuse, which led to sexual abuse.
Although Giuffre's allegations did not become part of criminal prosecutions against Epstein, she is central to conspiracy theories about the case. She accused Epstein of pressuring her into having sex with powerful men.
Maxwell — who has denied Giuffre’s allegations — is serving a 20-year prison sentence in a Florida federal prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls.
Earlier this month, the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Maxwell to testify before lawmakers on 11 August.
A spokeswoman for the committee said on Tuesday that the panel would not consider granting the immunity she requested in exchange for her testimony.
The potential interview is part of a frenzied, renewed interest in the Epstein saga following the US Justice Department's statement earlier this month that it would not be releasing any additional records from the investigation.
In an apparent U-turn, US Attorney General Pam Bondi walked back the notion that Epstein had kept a ""client list"" of elites who took part in his trafficking of underage girls.
The abrupt announcement stunned online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump's political base who had been hoping to find proof of a government cover-up.
Since then, the Trump administration has sought to present itself as promoting transparency, with the department urging courts to unseal grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking investigations. A judge in Florida last week rejected the request, although similar requests are pending in New York.
Separately, Maxwell's lawyers have urged the US Supreme Court to review her conviction, saying she did not receive a fair trial.
They also say that one way she would testify ""openly and honestly, in public,"" is in the event of a pardon by Trump. The president has told reporters that such a move is within his rights, but that he has not been asked to do so.
""She welcomes the opportunity to share the truth and dispel the many misconceptions and misstatements that have plagued this case from the beginning,"" her lawyers said."
https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/07/30/entrepreneur-like-a-ukrainian-100000-ukrainian-companies-have-opened-in-poland-since-2022,"Entrepreneur like a Ukrainian: 100,000 Ukrainian companies have opened in Poland since 2022",N/A,2025-07-30 14:36:18 +02:00,"At the beginning of July 2025, 29,044 companies owned by Ukrainians were recorded in the Polish National Court Register. Of this number, 13,014 companies were opened after February 2022, i.e. after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in around one million refugees from Ukraine settling in Poland.
Gremi Personal's analytical centre highlights that approximately 6% of all new companies registered in Poland in the last 3.5 years are owned by Ukrainians, and the total capital of companies established after the outbreak of war exceeds PLN 533 million (approximately €125 million).
In 2024, Ukrainian entrepreneurs and employees paid almost PLN 1.65 billion (€385 million) to the Polish budget in the form of income and corporate income taxes.
""These figures show that Ukrainians in Poland are strengthening the economy and positively influencing its development through their substantial contribution in the form of taxes, but also daily consumption. And they don't take work away, they give it to others, which also affects the quality of services and business competition,"" said Damian Guzman, Deputy CEO of Gremi Personal.
""Of course, when doing business in Poland, they should adapt to the rules of our economy and business and, if they want to develop further, they must do so on the basis of the principles prevailing here and in the European Union. And this may be a challenge for some of them, as doing business in Ukraine differs in many 'aspects' from doing business in Poland.""
But establishing a company is not the most popular way Ukrainians are doing business in Poland. According to the Polish Economic Institute, from the beginning of 2022 to April 2025, Ukrainian citizens established 88,500 sole proprietorships (JDG)—a simplified way to be self-employed in Poland—including more than 33,000 last year.
This means that, including companies, more than 100,000 Ukrainian businesses have been established in Poland since the outbreak of the war. Currently, every tenth JDG established in Poland is a Ukrainian business, and among the business activities registered by foreigners, Ukrainian businesses account for 85%.
""The sectoral structure of registered business activities indicates the dominance of construction, IT and service activity companies. These three sectors account for more than half of all established companies,"" Dr Katarzyna Dębkowska, head of the Economic Foresight Team at the Polish Institue of Economics (PIE) told Euronews.**
She pointed out that Ukrainian construction companies are mainly engaged in finishing activities, IT companies specialise in programming, and over 80% of service activities are hairdressing and beauty companies.
According to Dr Dębkowska, there are three main reasons. Firstly, it is the best way for them to work according to their competences, because, according to research, Ukrainians employed in Poland on a permanent basis or on a contract basis usually get a position below their competences.
The second reason is accounting and taxation issues—Polish companies often require JDG status from their employees. The third reason is the prospects related to the European Union market—registering a company in Poland gives access to the entire EU market.
On the other hand, many Ukrainian entities operate very locally. ""Emerging Ukrainian businesses often offer products or services mainly aimed at Ukrainian citizens living in Poland, e.g. beauty establishments, catering, educational units,"" Dębkowska said.
Dębkowska also emphasised that companies run by Ukrainian citizens are in line with the needs of the Polish economy and partially fill the gaps in the labour market, as evidenced by the share of construction, ICT or transport and logistics companies.
""The entrepreneurship of immigrants, including Ukrainian citizens, supports economic development, innovation and competitive advantages. Immigrants create jobs, especially in their own communities, and fill market niches. Through transnational connections, there is an opportunity to internationalise companies and transfer knowledge. Highly skilled immigrants accelerate technological development and increase the number of patents,"" Dr Katarzyna Dębkowska concluded."

“While the final version of the Code comes closer to supporting Europe’s innovation and economic goals [...] we remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing down Europe’s development and deployment of AI,” the president of global affairs at Google’s parent company Alphabet, Kent Walker, said in a blogpost on Wednesday.
“In particular departures from EU copyright law, steps that slow approvals, or requirements that expose trade secrets could chill European model development and deployments, harming Europe’s competitiveness,” Walker said.
The Code, which the European Commissionreleasedearlier this month, is a voluntary set of rules that touches on transparency, copyright, and safety and security issues, aiming to help providers of GPAI models comply with the AI Act.
Those providers who sign up are expected to be compliant with the AI Act and can anticipate more legal certainty, others will face more inspections.
The rules on GPAI under the AI Act enter into force on 2 August. Companies that already have tools on the market will have two years to implement the rules. Tools launched after that date must be compliant with immediate effect.
US tech giant Metasaidlast week that it will not sign, having slammed the rules for stifling innovation. The drafting process of the Code has also received criticism from rightsholders, fearing it is a violation of copyright rules.
The Commission will make public a list with the signatories on 1 August.
Google said in its statement that it’s committed to work with the AI Office to ensure that the Code is “proportionate and responsive to the rapid and dynamic evolution of AI”."
https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/29/gunman-opens-fire-at-manhattan-office-building-in-new-york-city-killing-at-least-four-peop,Gunman kills four at Manhattan office building in New York City,N/A,2025-07-29 05:21:49 +02:00,"A gunman killed four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer, and wounded a fifth when he opened fire at a midtown Manhattan office building on Monday evening, before fatally shooting himself.
The suspect was identified as Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident.
Tamura is believed to have acted alone, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a press conference. She added that an investigation into a possible motive of the gunman and why he targeted that particular location is under way.
Inside the vehicle he used to travel cross-country to New York City, ""officers found a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack and medication prescribed to Mr Tamura,"" Tisch said.
Surveillance footage showed the man exiting a BMW just before 6:30 pm local time (0:30 am Tuesday CEST) carrying an M4 assault rifle. He then made his way to a skyscraper located in a busy area of midtown, just a few blocks away from Central Park.
The office building houses some of the country's top financial firms, including the offices of Blackstone and KPMG, the Irish consulate and the National Football League (NFL) headquarters.
It is in the same part of Manhattan where the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare was shot down outside of a hotel in December.
The gunman entered the lobby of the building, where he killed an off-duty NYPD officer working a corporate security and a woman. He also shot another man, as per the victim's statement from the hospital.
The shooter then proceeded to the elevator, where he allowed a woman exiting to walk past him unharmed. Finally, he travelled to the 33rd floor, killing another person, before killing himself.
The officer who was fatally shot was Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old of Bangladeshi background who had served as a police officer in New York City for three and a half years, police Commissioner Tisch confirmed.
“He died as he lived. A hero,” she said, adding that he was married with two children, and his wife is pregnant with their third child."
https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/30/japanese-walking-experts-say-wellness-trend-can-boost-strength-fitness-and-heart-health,"Japanese walking: Experts say wellness trend can boost strength, fitness, and heart health",N/A,2025-07-30 07:00:04 +02:00,"A fitness routine developed by Japanese researchers in 2007 has recently found fresh legs on TikTok, where it’s being promoted as an enjoyable, low-barrier, and high-impact way to improve cardiovascular health, strength, and endurance.
Known as ""Japanese walking,"" the method is incredibly simple: alternating three minutes of fast-paced walking with three minutes at a slower pace, repeated over 30 minutes.
It was first introduced in a2007 studyled by Hiroshi Nose and Shizue Masuki, professors at Shinshu University. Researchers randomly assigned 246 older adults into three groups: no walking, moderate-intensity continuous walking, and high-intensity interval walking.
The results were eye-opening. People who followed the interval walking program for five months experienced greater increases in leg strength and overall physical fitness, as well as a greater reduction in blood pressure, compared to those who only walked at a moderate pace.
Additional research has expanded on the original 2007 findings. Afollow-up studyinvolving more than 700 participants found that interval walking also improved symptoms of age and lifestyle-related conditions, including changes in cognitive function, depression, and sleep quality.
Now, nearly two decades later, the method is seeing renewed attention on social media, particular under the #FitTok category on TikTok.
This type of interval walking taps into the ""overload principle"" – a key concept in exercise physiology where short bursts of exertion challenge the body just enough to force it to adapt.
“One’s fitness and health is affected by both how healthy the muscles are in terms of their metabolism and how well your heart and lungs and circulation work,"" John Buckley, a professor of exercise physiology at Keele University in the United Kingdom, told Euronews Health.
“To get those organs to adapt, we have to push them,"" he added. ""By inducing these little zaps of hard exercise, we are pushing the muscles and the heart and lungs into a region where they then have to adapt a bit more"".
This mirrors evolutionary patterns of movement. Humans are built for intermittent bursts of high effort – such as hunting and escaping danger – interspersed with prolonged, lower-intensity activity.
By helping people get more high-intensity activity, Japanese walking could help with key health issues related to exercise and nutrition, including diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, Buckley said.
The method could help target these conditions by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing blood pressure, and boosting post exercise energy expenditure.
“Even modest amounts of activity can bring our blood glucose down and can bring our blood pressure down,” Buckley said.
“Those two things are probably the long term things that have the biggest effect on people's heart and people's circulation to their brain to prevent them from having a stroke"".
While the physical effects of Japanese walking are well-documented, Buckley also sees a potential boost to mental health in the method.
“Physical activity, if you look at the evidence, has as strong a benefit,” he said.
He said the focus required during high-intensity intervals may even create a mindfulness effect.
“If you have to up the intensity, then your mind has to be focused on that activity at the time,"" he said.
This is backed by arecent reviewwhich found that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety, particularly in individuals with lower baseline anxiety.
The method is also incredibly flexible and can be easily applied to other types of exercise such as cycling, swimming, or even resistance training.
So yes, TikTok might have actually stumbled on a fitness trend that’s well worth the hype."
https://www.euronews.com/travel/2025/07/29/how-to-stay-safe-if-youre-visiting-greece-and-turkiye-during-summer-wildfire-season,Is it safe to travel to Greece and Türkiye? Here’s how to prepare for summer wildfires,N/A,2025-07-29 14:45:54 +02:00,"This summer has seen dozens of heatwaves bake Europe, creating prime conditions for wildfires to break out, particularly in Greece and Türkiye.
Summer blazes are common in the eastern Mediterranean region, where experts warn that climate change is exacerbating the situation.
If you are planning to travel to wildfire-prone areas this summer, here are some precautions you can take to ensure your safety should an emergency situation occur.
June and July have seen wildfires erupt over swathes of heat-scorched Europe.
On Monday, Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli said Türkiye faced a “very risky week” for outbreaks after blazes neared Bursa, the country's fourth-largest city, over the weekend.
More than 3,500 people were forced to flee their homes, and three volunteer firefighters tackling the flames were killed after their water tanker overturned, local news agency IHA reported.
Separately, officials said earlier on Sunday, a firefighter died of a heart attack while battling a blaze. The fatalities brought the total deaths over the past month to 17, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers killed in awildfirein the western city of Eskisehir.
A wildfire erupted on Monday in forests outside the western port city of Izmir, where 11 aircraft were helping ground-based fire units and residents battle the blaze.
The government had earlier declared disaster areas in two western provinces, Izmir and Bilecik.
In Greece, firefighters raced to tackle a wildfire that broke out on Monday near a university campus close to the centre of Athens.
Water-dropping planes and helicopters reinforced 110 firefighters on the ground, the fire department said.
A waning fire on the island of Kythera, which lies south of the Peloponnese, was reinvigorated by strong winds. Over the weekend, the blaze burned through around 10 per cent of the small island’s land mass, triggering the evacuation of several villages.
Earlier in July, a coastal wildfire broke out on the island ofCrete, where more than 5,000 tourists, hotel workers and residents were evacuated from seaside areas on the south coast.
A key precautionary measure when visitingwildfire-prone destinationsis staying informed of any warnings.
Before your trip, research the specific area you're visiting and be aware of the fire danger ratings and local emergency procedures.
Ensure that your mobile phone is registered to receive emergency alerts. You can do this by going into Settings, followed by Notifications, and Enabling Alerts.
Monitor local news, weather forecasts, and fire updates through official channels like emergency apps and websites.
If travelling to Greece, for example, register for alerts from theGreek government’s Emergency Communication Service. You should also follow@112Greeceon X for official updates.
The UK government also recommends preparing a ‘grab bag’ of essentials, including passports and ID cards, mobile phones and chargers, money and bank cards, essential medicine, and insurance documents.
When booking travel insurance, make sure you choose a policy that will refund you or entitle you to compensation shouldwildfiresaffect your holiday.
This is particularly important if you choose not to go ahead with your trip, even if the airline, tour operator or accommodation has not cancelled your bookings.
This is because, without an official ‘no-go’ warning from foreign governments, travellers who choose not to go ahead with their trip are unlikely to receive reimbursement or compensation, as this is considered “disinclination to travel”.
The vast majority oftravel insurancepolicies will also not cover situations of “loss of enjoyment” due to wildfires, which includes being unable to leave your hotel.
Travellers can only expect refunds if their flights or accommodation are cancelled by airlines, providers or tour companies.
Some insurance policies include trip disruption or natural disaster cover, which usually applies to wildfire-related issues, but not every company will offer this, so make sure you have the correct insurance before you leave."
https://www.euronews.com/travel/2025/07/27/ice-cream-for-breakfast-these-european-destinations-serve-sweet-local-treats-worth-travell,Ice cream for breakfast? These European destinations serve sweet local treats worth travelling,N/A,2025-07-27 10:03:44 +02:00,"Europe may be home to creamy Italian gelato and elegant French parfaits, but the continent’s best ice cream isn’t always the most obvious.
From Lapland to the lowlands, local traditions come to life across Europe in unexpected ice cream creations. Think pasta-shaped sundaes, chewy, goat’s milk cones that don’t melt in the sun and a very special treat for breakfast – yes, breakfast.
Here are five scoops of ice cream worth travelling for in Europe.
Don’t be fooled: this isn’t pasta. Spaghettieis is a playfulGermaninvention that mimics a plate of spaghetti.
It’s made with vanilla ice cream squeezed through a press to resemble noodles, then topped with strawberry sauce “marinara” and white chocolate “Parmesan.”
The German treat was invented in 1969 by Dario Fontanella inMannheim. While purists might want to visit his Eis Fontanella for the original version, the dish today has become a beloved classic and can be found across Germany.
In Munich, locals still line up at family-run Eiscafé Sarcletti - a fixture in the city since 1879 - where you can order the nostalgic dish in a dozen creative variations.
InSicily, ice cream isn’t just for dessert. Locals like to beat the summer heat with a brioche con gelato. For breakfast.
A split, slightly sweet brioche bun comes stuffed with scoops of creamy gelato – or with granita on the side, if you prefer - and is often topped with whipped cream or nuts. The pairing may sound indulgent, but it’s as common as espresso onthe island.
The tradition dates to the 1800s and reflects the Sicilian love of contrasts - hot and cold, soft and firm, rich and refreshing. Classic flavours like pistachio, almond and stracciatella (vanilla gelato with chocolate swirled through it) are perennial favourites.
Brioche con gelato is usually served with a spoon, but you can eat it like a sandwich, too. You’ll find it everywhere in Palermo or along the coast in towns like Taormina and Noto. For a classic, try Don Peppinu inCatania, where the pistachio brioche is legendary.
Dondurma isn’t your average scoop of ice cream. Typically made with goat’s milk, salep (orchid root flour), mastic (resin) and sugar, Türkiye’s traditional ice cream is elastic, chewy and slow to melt. So much so that it’s often eaten with a knife and fork.
The treat dates back centuries to the Kahramanmaraş region in the southeast, but it’s now ubiquitous acrossTürkiye, from village fairs to Istanbul’s promenades.
Vendors often put on a show, flipping cones upside down or pulling the ice cream like taffy to amuse customers. Some will even play a cat-and-mouse game with you, but rest assured that it’s all for fun.
Popular flavours include pistachio, chocolate and cherry, but you can get more adventurous with variations such as saffron almond, clotted cream and piney mastic.
In Istanbul, head to Mado, a national chain that originated in the dondurma heartland and now serves up the classic Turkish treat inhistoric locationslike Beyoğlu.
Despite its name, café liégeois has nothing to do with the Belgian city of Liège. Originally known as café viennois, France renamed thedessertduring World War I to honour the people of Liège for resisting German occupation.
The drink-dessert hybrid features scoops of coffee-flavoured ice cream layered with chilled coffee and topped with a swirl of Chantilly cream – a fluffy, high-fat dairy cream often laced with vanilla. It’s a decadent and refreshingly bittersweet pick-me-up.
For a taste of the classic in a setting steeped in history, visit Café de la Paix. Located in what is now the Intercontinental hotel, the 19th-century institution overlooks the Palais Garnier opera house and is pureParisian grandeur.
Sweet, tart and impossible to cultivate commercially at scale, cloudberries are one of the Arctic’s most elusive treasures.
These golden-orange fruits, found in the wild marshes and bogs in Sweden, Norway and Finland, are foraged in late summer and have long been a staple of IndigenousSami traditions. Their fleeting season and remote habitat make them a prized ingredient for everything from jam to liqueur. But the real indulgence is cloudberry ice cream.
In Finland’s north, the Arctic Ice Cream Factory swirls the berries into creamy scoops best enjoyed after a trek across the tundra or under themidnight sun.
Across the border in Sweden, the Brandon Lodge in coastal Luleå and the Grand-Hotel Stockholm have each created decadent scoops of the seasonal treat – the latter with the help of local ice cream makers Otto & Glassfabriken."

Spain’s National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) launched the investigation in July 2024, accusing Apple of “imposing unfair commercial conditions” on the developers of mobile applications that are sold in its App Store.
Apple could be “abusing its dominant market position,” the regulator said.
On Tuesday, the CNMC said it will broaden the probe due to “new evidence” that the tech giant requires developers to follow a pricing schedule set by Apple in order to sell their apps in its marketplace.
“This would constitute conduct restricting competition between companies,” in violation of European Union law, the regulator said.
The CNMC has one more year to complete its investigation, and said the expansion “does not prejudge the outcome”.
Apple has denied the allegations. On Tuesday, the company said it had created its App Store ""to be a safe and trusted experience for users and a great business opportunity for developers in Spain and around the world"".
""We will continue to engage with the Spanish Competition Authority to ensure our concerns are fully understood,"" Apple said in a statement.
The Spanish probe follows two investigations from the European Commission. Last year, the Commission fined Applemore than €1.8 billionin a case related to music streaming apps for iPhones and iPads.
It said Apple placed restrictions on app developers that prevented them from telling users about cheaper music subscription services available outside of its app, violating EU rules on “anti-steering provisions”.
In April, the Commission said it closed another investigation into whether Apple had violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA), after the company agreed to make it easier for users to change default settings for browsers, calling, messaging, and more.

https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/07/30/australia-adds-youtube-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-age-16,Australia adds YouTube to social media ban for children under age 16,N/A,2025-07-30 10:56:04 +02:00,"Australian teenagers under age 16 will be barred from making YouTube accounts, in an expansion of the country’s world-first ban on social media for young people.
The decision comes after the country’s internet regulator asked the government to include YouTube in itsban on social mediafor under-16s last month. A previous decision had allowed YouTube to sidestep the policy, which will go into effect later this year.
“We know that social media is doing social harm,” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s centre-left prime minister, said during a pressconference.
“My government and this parliament are ready to take action to protect young Australians”.
The ban for under-16s also includes social mediaplatformslike Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X.
Many Australians appear on board with some age restrictions. In a survey of nearly 4,000 Australians published last month, around nine out of ten respondents said they want some type of “age assurance” on socialmedia.
About three in four 10- to 15-year-olds in Australia have used YouTube, making it more popular than other major platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, according to asurveyfrom the office of eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.
Last month, Inman Grant recommended that YouTube beincludedin the social media ban due to evidence that children experience harmful content on the platform.
In the survey, 37 per cent of children who had seen any harmful content online said they saw it on YouTube.
“Given the known risk of harms on YouTube … and without sufficient evidence demonstrating that YouTube predominately provides beneficial experiences for children under 16, providing a specific carve out for YouTube appears to be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act,” Inman Grant’s June recommendations read.
Under the new rules, children under 16 will still be able to access YouTube, but they will not be able to make accounts.
In a statement, YouTube said it shares the government’s goal of “addressing and reducing online harms,” but that it should not be included in the ban because of the service it provides.
“Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content,” the companysaid. “It’s not social media”.
Australia had previously excluded YouTube from the social media ban because it is a service that “[is] primarily for the purposes of education and health support,” the government said in a press release from last year.
YouTube said it is “considering next steps” while continuing to work with the government. Australian media reported that this could include a court challenge.
The ban officially comes into place on December 10."

The first flight operated by Russian carrier Nordwind took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday, carrying over 400 passengers, and landed in North Korea's capital around eight hours later.
Tickets for the flight were priced at 45,000 rubles (around €480), according to Russian state media outlet TASS. It reported that authorities gave Norwind permission to fly to North Korea in July.
The airline used to carry Russians to holiday destinations across Europe, including Spain and Germany, until the EU banned Russian carriers from operating in its airspace in 2022.
Russia's Transport Ministry said there will be one flight a month to meet demand. It may be the first regular flight between the two capital cities since the mid-1990s, according to Russian aviation blogs and follows the resumption of the 10-day Moscow to Pyongyang rail service in June.
Previously, the only direct flight between Russia and North Korea was the service from Vladivostok in Russia's Far East.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who visited North Korea'snew Wonsan-Kalma beach resortearlier this month to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, promised to encourage Russian tourists to visit the complex.
Theresort, which can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the centre of Kim’s push to boost tourism to improve his country’s troubled economy.
North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn’t said if it will fully resumeinternational tourism. Restrictions still largely ban foreign tourists from entering the country.
Regular flights between Russia’s eastern port city of Vladivostok and Pyongyang reopened in 2023 following a break caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Russia and North Korea have sharply expanded military and other ties in recent years, with Pyongyang supplying weapons and troops to back Russia’s military action in Ukraine."
https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/07/30/us-and-china-agree-to-extend-tariff-pause-after-stockholm-trade-talks,US and China prepare to extend tariff pause after Stockholm talks,N/A,2025-07-30 07:45:24 +02:00,"The United States and China have agreed to work on extending a deadline for new tariffs on each other after two days of trade talks in Stockholm concluded on Tuesday, according to Beijing’s lead negotiator.
The US side said the extension was discussed, but still required approval from President Donald Trump. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed ""our Chinese counterparts have jumped the gun a little"" when announcing a pause, although he described the talks as “very fulsome two days with the Chinese delegation"".
China said the two sides had “in-depth, candid and constructive” discussions and agreed to work on extending a pause in tariffs beyond a 12 August deadline for a trade deal for another 90 days.
“A stable, healthy and sustainable China-US economic and trade relationship serves not only the two countries’ respective development goals but also contributes to global economic growth and stability,” said China's Vice Premier He Lifeng, who led the Chinese side, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce. He did not say how the extension would work.
Bessent added that the two sides touched on US concerns over China's purchase of Iranian oil, supply of dual-use tech to Russia that could be used on the battlefield, and the manufacturing of goods at a rate beyond what is sustained by global demand.
“We just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it's the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,” Bessent said.
He stressed that the US seeks to restore domestic manufacturing, secure purchase agreements of US agricultural and energy products, and reduce trade deficits.
The latest round of talks opened Monday in Stockholm to try to break a logjam over tariffs that have skewed the pivotal commercial ties between the world’s two largest economies.
The two sides previously met in Geneva and London to address specific issues — triple-digit tariffs that amounted to a trade embargo and export controls on critical products — China's chokehold on rare earth magnets, and US restrictions on semiconductors.
Monday's discussions lasted nearly five hours behind closed doors at the office of Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. Before the talks resumed Tuesday, Kristersson met with Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer over breakfast.
The talks in Stockholm unfolded as President Donald Trump is mulling plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, a summit that could be a crucial step toward locking in any major agreements between their two countries.
“I would say before the end of the year,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday.
On his Truth Social media platform, Trump insisted late Monday that he was not “seeking” a summit with Xi, but may go to China at the Chinese leader’s invitation, “which has been extended"". ""Otherwise, no interest!” he added.
Bessent told reporters the summit was not discussed in Stockholm but that they did talk about “the desire of the two presidents for the trade team and the Treasury team to have trade negotiations with our Chinese counterparts"".
Greer said the American team would head back to Washington and “talk to the president about” the extension of the August deadline and see “whether that’s something that he wants to do"".
The US has struck deals over tariffs with some of its key trading partners — including Britain, Japan and the European Union — since Trump announced earlier in July elevated tariff rates against dozens of countries. China remains perhaps the biggest challenge.
“The Chinese have been very pragmatic,” Greer said in comments posted on social media by his office late Monday. “We have tensions now, but the fact that we are regularly meeting with them to address these issues gives us a good footing for these negotiations.”
Many analysts had expected that the Stockholm talks would result in an extension of current tariff levels, which are far lower than the triple-digit percentage rates proposed as the US-China tariff tiff reached a crescendo in April, sending world markets into a temporary tailspin.
The two sides deescalated tensions during bilateral talks in Geneva in May and agreed to a 90-day pause on sky-high tariffs — which ends 12 August. The US duties currently stand at 30% on Chinese goods, while China is placing a 10% tariff on US products.
While China has offered few specifics of its goals in the Stockholm talks, Bessent has suggested that the situation has stabilised to the point that Beijing and Washington can start looking toward longer-term balance between their economies.
Since China vaulted into the global trading system more than two decades ago, Washington has sought to press Beijing to encourage more consumption at home and offer greater market access to foreign, including American-made goods.
Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Trump’s team would today face challenges from “a large and confident partner that is more than willing to retaliate against US interests"".
Rollover of tariff rates “should be the easy part”, she said, warning that Beijing has learned lessons since the first Trump administration and “will not buy into a one-sided deal this time around"".
Bessent said the “overall tone of the meetings was very constructive"" while Li said the two sides agreed in Stockholm to keep close contact and to “communicate with each other in a timely manner on trade and economic issues"".
On Monday, police cordoned off a security zone along Stockholm’s vast waterfront as curious tourists and locals sought a glimpse of the top-tier officials through a phalanx of TV news cameras lined up behind metal barriers.
Flagpoles at the prime minister’s office were festooned with the American and Chinese flags."

The Youth Jubilee will incorporate World Youth Day this year, as announced in 2023 by the late Pope Francis.
Around a thousand parishes, schools and families will provide accommodation and breakfast for pilgrims in addition to a large hostel capable of hosting about 25,000 people set up at the Fiera di Roma.
Other facilities include discounted meal vouchers, shower services at major public transport hubs, almost 3,000 chemical toilets on the streets of Rome and the upgrade of underground and regional trains and buses.
Security measures have been put in place. Gates have been set up to prevent dangerous materials and objects into certain areas. Pilgrims have been asked to carry only the bare essentials to facilitate controls.
A 400 square metre control room will manage the flow of surveillance cameras in the event areas.
Pilgrims will be able to spend the night on the law in front of Tor Vergata as they await the Pope's morning mass on Sunday.
Volunteers will distribute water bottles and an app by municipal company Acea will provide a map of the 2,660 free water supply points in Rome.
Aside from the Pope's evening mass on Tuesday, Philippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle celebrated Mass for Catholic influencers and digital missionaries.
Numerous minor events will be held in the city between Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, the Circus Maximus will host a Day of Penance in which 200 stations will be made available for pilgrims to hear confessions.
Saturday will be dedicated to music, with groups taking turn to entertain the crowd on a stage set up at Tor Vergata. The area has 355 tents and gazebos, 2,400 square metres of video screens and 110 generators, 20km of fibre optics and 15km of electric cables."

https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/07/29/european-automotive-giant-stellantis-faces-15-billion-hit-from-us-tariffs-this-year,European automotive giant Stellantis faces €1.5 billion hit from US tariffs this year,N/A,2025-07-29 18:18:49 +02:00,"The second-biggest carmaker in Europe has forecast that US tariffs could cost it €1.5 billion this year as the EU has failed to avert auto levies imposed by the Trump administration.
The producers of luxury Maserati cars as well as mid-range and affordable favourites such as Lancia, Peugeot and Fiat, said on Tuesday that net profits plummeted from €5.6bn in the same period last year. This was as it burned €3.3 billion in cash for the cancellation of a hydrogen fuel cell project. Changes in the fine regime for US carbon emission regulations and write-downs on platform investments also hit profits.
US President Donald Trump’s tariffs cost the company €300 million in the first six months of the year, Stellantis said.
Losses like these could crank up political and labour pressure as the carmaker faces a heightened risk of plant shutdowns, delayed model launches and fights with unions as management scrambles to manage the cash gap.
Carmakers are the main drivers of European industry. The sector pumps out roughly 7% of EU GDP according to the European Commission, supports  around 14 million jobs across its supply chains and delivers one of the bloc’s biggest export surpluses each year.
Automakers also pour more than €70bnannuallyinto engineering and technological innovation. A dip in their fortunes can therefore ripple into technology, steel, chemicals, logistics and the continent's drive for innovation.
Stellantis said it expected net revenues to increase over the next six months compared with the first half, when they dropped 13% to €74.3bn. The carmaker also said cash flow would improve.
Incoming CEO Antonio Filosa, who was confirmed in the role last month, said the new executive team would ""continue to make the tough decisions needed to re-establish profitable growth and significantly improve results"".
“My first weeks as CEO have reconfirmed my strong conviction that we will fix what’s wrong with Stellantis,’’ Filosa said in a statement."

The governor of Hawaii has warned residents that bigger waves could be on the way, after the first waves hit the island state following a tsunami warning triggered by a massive quake in a remote part of Russia.
The first waves, measuring 1.74 metres, were recorded at Kahului on Maui, with another measuring 1.49 metres recorded in Hilo. No significant damages have yet been recorded.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green told a news conference that further waves are to be expected after significant amounts of water receded along beaches — a typical sign of an imminent tsunami wave, Green said.
""That doesn't happen for no reason,"" Green said. He added:  ""That means there's activity in the ocean.""
Two waves, including one at a height of 1.82 metres, were measured travelling towards the island.
The Hawaii Country Civil Defence Agency wrote on X that the danger wasn't ""over yet"".
""Initial wave impacts from the leading edge of the tsunami measured several feet at some monitoring stations, but 'follow-up' waves over the next several hours often are larger. Don't return to evacuated areas until the tsunami warning is officially lifted,"" it explained.
Residents have been advised to ensure they are at least 30 metres above sea level or two miles inland to be safe from the incoming waves. Flights in and out of Maui Airport have been cancelled.
Additional waves of half a metre have been recorded in California, the US National Weather Service said. Tsunami warnings in the state are in effect from Cape Mendocino to the state's border with Oregon.
The tsunami warnings were triggered after one of the strongest earthquakes on record struck Russia's Far East on Wednesday morning.
Damage has been recorded and evacuations issued in Russia's Kamchatka peninsula — the epicentre of the 8.8 magnitude quake.
The powerful quake has triggered tsunami waves in parts of Japan and Alaska and sparked warnings in parts of North and Central America and the Pacific Islands."

With ambitious targets to phase out new petrol and diesel powered cars in the EU by 2035, an influx of Chinese EV brands such anBYDentering Europe and trade tariffs threatening the export market, the European automotive industry is at a critical moment.
“I think to have a credible end date for combustion cars there needs to be a very credible date also for investments and expansion of the charging networks. Otherwise, it will not be possible to be all electric by 2035,” Håkan Samuelsson,CEO and president of VolvoCars, told Euronews.
But what else needs to be done to ensure the industry stays alive, kicking and competitive?
In this episode of The Big Question, Eleanor Butler sat down with Håkan Samuelsson to discuss the future of the automotive industry in Europe.
In order to meet climate targets, the EU has introduced carbon limits for carmakers, looking at average emissions across a fleet.
Many carmakers have sought to collaborate with other firms on these targets, forming “pools” and combining their emissions. This means that companies with low-carbon or zero-carbon fleets can sell credits to more polluting automakers, permitting them to use a portion of their allowance.
WhileEV frontrunnersbenefitted from these targets, demands are now softening. For instance, automakers can now average their emissions over three years instead of one. This means that if they overshoot the limit for one year, they can aim to undershoot for the next and avoid penalties.
“We plan, we develop these cars and we also, of course, saw value in emission credits that we could sell to other builders who are not as fast. And I think that's a good way of using that money to speed up the transition. And that is, of course, a big drawback now with the delay of everything, which is not good for our company,” Håkan told The Big Question.
He also added that although countries like Norway are very advanced with theircharging infrastructure, EV targets will not be met until charging capacity is boosted across the bloc.
“I think we need to rely on the possibilities to drive on a combustion engine when you lack charging possibilities,” Håkan added.
While some European carmakers are calling on the EU to impose tariffs on foreign competitors, Håkan takes a more liberal approach.
“There is really no protection in the form oftariffsor other ways. The only protection for our industry is that we shape up and we need to be more competitive.”
“I think a good forecast is that we will have very tough competition from new Chinese EV players [in the EU]. And then the sooner we get used to that and the sooner we start developing our cars, the better,” Håkan told The Big Question.
In Europe, Volvo has already begun to produce the popular EX30 model in Ghent, Belgium in a bid to reduce delivery time and transportation costs and emissions.
It’s a similar situation in the US, where Volvo has a production plant in Charleston, South Carolina. Håkan hopes to increase production capacity here, not only to avoidTrump’s tariffsbut also to be closer to the customer base.
“We need now to find a bread-and-butter model that can sell in high volumes, which we can deliver faster to our customers and of course reduce stock and transportation costs. Solocal productionis not only a cost increase, it has advantages also.
“So even if the tariffs come down to a more reasonable level, we still need to use our factory more than we do today,” he added.
And in China, Håkan stressed that Volvo needs to really focus on what the local market is asking for, rather than replicating European offerings.
“Chinese customers are very tech-interested, so they like a lot of software features in their cars,” he explained.
“And I think that’s an example of a situation where you can’t just put European-developed features in the car, you need to develop [the tech] together with the Chinese to really lead.”

Car paints are usually made of resin, a material in which the molecules vibrate and generate heat under the sun, driving up the temperature.
The temperature of a car dashboard can go up to 70 degrees Celsius in scorching summer, according to a study published by researchers from Arizona State University and the UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Japanese carmaker Nissan is developing an automotive paint that can cool the vehicle down.
Nissan’s cool paint contains metamaterial with two microstructure particles – One to block and reflect near-infrared rays in the sunlight, and the other to convert heat into electromagnetic waves and release them to the space above Earth’s atmosphere.
This helps keep the temperature from rising.
The company says the effect is particularly noticeable when a vehicle is parked in the sun for an extended period.
It also helps reduce the need to run the air-conditioning and unburden the engine, or if it’s an electric vehicle, the battery.
The white paint is still in the trial stage.
In a field test conducted in August 2024 at Tokyo International Air Terminal in Japan, the cool paint managed to bring down exterior surfaces and cabin temperatures by 12 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees, respectively, compared to traditional automotive paint.

https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/29/ai-battled-doctors-in-a-live-showdown-to-diagnose-patients-who-came-out-on-top,AI battled doctors in a live showdown to diagnose patients. Who came out on top?,N/A,2025-07-29 14:14:22 +02:00,"A face-off between humans and machines drew crowds at the World AI Conference in Shanghai, where radiologists went head-to-head withartificial intelligencein a live competition.
The AI-Human Synergy Competition featured six top radiologists from Zhongshan Hospital, split into two teams: the “AI Collaboration Group"" that had a helping hand from an AI system, and the “Manual Group” which relied solely on their personal expertise.
Both teams were presented with the same chest x-ray cases and asked to analyse and report their findings live.
Although the AI-assisted team worked faster, they missed some important diagnoses, and the human team was able to identify conditions the AI group missed. According to experts, the human report was also more readable, with a warmer tone and better overall structure.
""I noticed our senior physicians carefully adjusted the structure of the report,"" said Wang Yi, director of the radiology department at Peking University People's Hospital.
""They made it into a coherent report with clear internal logic, unlike the AI-generated version where each item was listed separately"".
""In terms of time, AI is definitely faster. Accuracy is roughly comparable, but I have to say the manual group feels warmer and more empathetic,"" said Zeng Mengsu, director of radiology and chief of diagnostic radiology at Zhongshan Hospital.
""Both cases involved ‘annual follow-ups,’ yet the doctor group without AI assistance also provided personalised recommendations – such as follow-up ultrasounds or revisits within 6 to 12 months,"" Mengsu added.
The technology used in the showdown was the “One-Scan-for-All” chest system, co-developed by Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai United Imaging Medical Technology.
Unlike conventional models that focus on detecting a single disease, this system is currently capable of identifying 73 common thoracic abnormalities in one scan, from pulmonary nodules and emphysema to fractures and coronary artery calcifications.
""Its current accuracy rate is around 85 per cent, and we aim to raise that to 95 per cent in the future – I’m confident we’ll get there,"" Zeng explained the event.
""Ultimately, we hope to double the work efficiency of radiologists through this technology"".
The team behind the AI also has broader ambitions beyond just focusing exclusively on lung-related issues.
Zhou Xiang, co-founder and co-CEO of United Imaging Intelligence, said the group is working on a brain MRI programme with the goal of having one scan for multiple health issues.
""So far, we've covered over 30 diseases and are now expanding into orthopedics, ultrasound, and abdominal imaging,"" Xiang said.
The showdown in Shanghai comes amid a wave of breakthroughs in AI medical diagnostics.Microsoftrecently announced that its latest AI tool outperformed doctors in a study involving complex medical cases.
Tested against 21 experienced physicians from the United Kingdom and United States, the system correctly diagnosed up to 85.5 per cent of patient cases - roughly four times more than the group of doctors.
The model was also cheaper than human doctors, ordering fewer scans and tests to reach the correct diagnosis, the analysis found. While the company isn’t suggesting AI will replace doctors, it believes these systems could dramatically improve speed, accuracy, and personalisation in health care."

TikTok is one of the most popular apps among young people, serving as a key source of news and information. But it has come under fire for what critics say can be harmful and addictive content.
The latest updates, which go beyond parental controls, come as politicians across Europeweigh whether to banchildren and young teenagers from social media.
Here are the key changes coming to TikTok.
TikTok is making updates to its Family Pairing tool, which allows parents to partner with their children to create a safer online environment.
The new version gives caregivers more features, including the ability to receive notifications when their child posts public content, check privacy settings - for example, whether video downloads are enabled - and hide specific accounts so that they do not appear in their child's feed.
Beginning in Europe, the company will also allow parents to block their children from seeing certain TikTok accounts.
""We heard from parents that they know best what content is suitable for their teen, and this tool gives them another way to customise their teen's TikTok experience,"" Suzy Loftus, head of trust and safety for TikTok US data security,said in a blog postexplaining the changes.
TikTok also launched a new wellbeing feature designed to help users build healthy online habits, from limiting screen time to learning about wellbeing tools.
The so-called ""missions"" are simple and accessible, with badges and access to additional materials awarded for completion. The whole thing will be integrated into a new wellbeing module, available directly in the app.
The company is also launching new features to help online creators operate in a less toxic environment.
For example, Creator Care Mode is a filter that automatically blocks offensive comments before they are published. New options for live streaming will allow specific words, phrases, and emojis to be muted in real time.
In response to the growing threat of online misinformation, TikTok is testing a Footnotes feature in the United States. Users can add context, sources, and other information underneath videos.
Similar to Community Notes on the social media platforms X and Facebook, TikTok is effectively looking to crowdsource quality control for the information on its app.
The new features will roll out globally in the coming months."
https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/27/can-you-actually-die-of-a-broken-heart-heres-what-the-science-says,Can you actually die of a broken heart? Here’s what the science says,N/A,2025-07-27 10:00:56 +02:00,"It might actually be possible to die of a broken heart, even years after the loss of a loved one, new research suggests.
Grief is a normal response to death, but for some bereaved people, it can cause serious physical and mental health problems in both the short- and long-term.
Now, a study has found that people who suffer from consistently high levels of intense grief are more likely to die within a decade of their closest loved ones.
A Danish research team spent a decade following more than 1,700 adults who had recently lost a partner, parent, or another close relative, dividing people into five groups based on the severity and consistency of their grief symptoms over time.
Over the 10-year period, people on the “high” grief trajectory – those with the longest-lasting, most intense grief – had a death rate that was 88 per cent higher than those with the lowest levels of grief symptoms, according to the study published in the journalFrontiers in Public Health.
Those in the high-grief group were also significantly more likely to be in therapy or taking antidepressant medicines more than three years after their loved one’s death. After seven years, those differences tapered off.
Researchers don’t yet know exactly why people hit hardest by grief were more likely to die in the next decade after their loved one’s death.
“We have previously found a connection between high grief symptom levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and even suicide. But the association with mortality should be further investigated,” Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University, said in a statement.
But she noted that people in the high-grief group tended to have lower education levels and take more mental health medicines before their loved one died.
That suggests “that they had signs of mental vulnerability which may cause greater distress on bereavement,” Nielsen said.
Overall, participants were aged 62 on average when the study began, meaning some of their health issues could also be explained by ageing. The majority were women.
The study was also small, with just 107 people in the high-grief group and 670 people in the low-grief group. Larger studies would be needed to confirm the findings.
But the study adds to a growing body of research on how emotional shocks affect our health. One such risk is takotsubo cardiomyopathy, commonly known as broken heart syndrome, because it is associated with stressful events like the death of a loved one.
It occurs when the heart temporarily enlarges and doesn’t pump well, causing heart failure that can be mistaken for a heart attack.
Women are more likely to suffer from broken heart syndrome, but men are more likely to die from the condition, according to a study published earlier this year in theJournal of the American Heart Association.
Another studyfound that grieving adults are more likely to die from heart disease and suicide in the three years after their spouses die. Men are also more likely to die from digestive or respiratory issues.
Nielsen said the latest results could help doctors become more aware of the signs to look out for if a patient in mourning could be at risk of having their own health deteriorate.
“They can then offer these patients tailored follow-up in general practice, or refer them to a private-practice psychologist or secondary care,” Nielsen said."

The Italian antitrust authority Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM) has accused Meta of violating the European Union's competition laws by integrating its AI chatbot into its messaging app WhatsApp, potentially abusing its ""dominant position"" in the market to promote its own AI services.
“Starting from March 2025, Meta, which holds a dominant position in the app-based communication services market, decided to pre-install its artificial intelligence service on the WhatsApp app,” AGCM wrote in astatement.
""In doing so, Meta may be 'imposing' the use of its chatbot and AI assistance services on its users,"" the antitrust authority continued.
It said that by linking Meta AI with WhatsApp, Meta appears to be steering its users into the AI market not through fair competition, but by forcing the two services together in violation of EU law.
On Tuesday, antitrust officials inspected Meta's Italian offices, the regulator said.
Concerns over Meta's AI models are not unique to Italy, with the Irish data protection authorityscrutinisingits use of users' data.
The technology giant’s AI tool had raised concerns in Brussels. It launched its AI models in Europeearlier this year, after a delay due to ""regulatory uncertainty"".
Meanwhile, theEuropean Commission, the EU's executive body, launched an inquiry in March into whether Meta's AI tool falls within the scope of the Digital Services Act (DSA).
Meta owns several major social media and messaging platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger."

The 38-year-old has Usher syndrome type 1b, a rare genetic disorder that causes profound deafness from birth and a progressive loss of vision, leading to blindness.
The surgery took place in July 2024 at the ophthalmology clinic of the University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" in southern Italy. At the time, the patient had a visual capacity of less than a tenth, seeing the world as if he was looking at it through a keyhole.
A year later, the patient has recovered both his near and far sight, even in low-light conditions, his doctors said during a press conference.
""Before, everything was blurry, indistinct. Now I can go out at night alone, recognise colleagues, read subtitles on TV from afar, see the aisles of the warehouse where I work without stumbling,"" the patient said.
""It's not just seeing better, it's starting to live,"" he added.
The operation marks the first clinical demonstration of the effectiveness of the new gene therapy, which was developed by researchers at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM) in Pozzuoli.
The operation involves injecting two separate viral vectors under the retina, each carrying half of the gene needed to produce the protein absent in Usher 1B patients.
""The operation takes place under general anaesthesia, but recovery is rapid,"" said Francesca Simonelli, director of Vanvitelli University's pphthalmology clinic.
""Already after a few days, an improvement is noticeable. At two weeks, the first patient could see better and at one month he was able to find his way even in the dark"".
""Today, one year later, his sight has been restored,"" Simonelli added.
Seven other patients also underwent the procedure from October 2024 to April 2025, none of whom had serious side effects.
The preliminary results are encouraging and will be followed by a second experimental phase with seven more patients entering the programme.
If it is successful, the therapy could become a new option for many patients suffering from genetic eye disorders."
https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/07/30/microsoft-authenticator-is-ending-password-autofill-heres-how-to-set-up-a-passkey-instead,Microsoft Authenticator is ending password autofill. Here's how to set up a passkey instead,N/A,2025-07-30 11:17:40 +02:00,"If you’re a Microsoft Authenticator user, you’ve probably received at least one notice that the app’s password management features are no longer usable and that your stored passwords will be inaccessible starting Aug. 1 unless you have the Edge browser.
Why? Because Microsoft is moving its signature sign-in app to a digital authentication method touted by security experts as an easier andmore secure way to log in: passkeys.
“Last year (2024), we observed a staggering 7,000 password attacks per second (more than double the rate from 2023),” Microsoft wrote in a blog post.
“Although passwords have been around for centuries, we hope their reign over our online world is ending”.
Authenticator has been a staple in providing multi-factor authentication, one-time passwords, and biometric logins for services and some websites. Although the app will continue to provide authentication for passkey-compatible services, it is pushing its password management and autofill functions out to the company’s Edge browser instead.
Note that not all websites and applications have adopted passkeys yet, so many places still rely on passwords.
If you haven’t yet moved to a different password manager system or set up your passkeys, we’re here to help.
Passkeys do away with complex 14 character passwords because you never need to see them. Instead you are using existing biometrics like your face or fingerprints, digital patterns, or PINs to access your accounts.
Passkeys are made up of two parts of a code that only makes sense when they’re combined, kind of like a digital key and padlock.
You keep half of the encrypted code, typically stored either in the cloud with a compatible verification app – including Authenticator – or on a physical security dongle. The other half is stored on the participating apps, services or accounts you want to access.
The bad news? You do have to set up individual passkeys for each service or application that accepts them. Keeping track of where you can use them versus traditional passwords can be challenging.
If you’ve opened Authenticator in the last few months, you likely were prompted to set up a passkey through a guided experience.
If you didn’t receive such a prompt, you can set up a new passkey by opening the authenticator app on your device. Find and tap on your account, then select “set up a passkey” option. Follow the app’s instructions.
The good news is that all of your old passwords are synced to your Microsoft account. But to access them after Aug. 1, you will need to first install the Edge browser on your device of choice (and log into it).
For iOS users, navigate to Settings General Autofill & Passwords and turn on Edge.
Android users click their way to Settings General management Passwords and autofill Autofill service and select Edge.
Laptop and desktop users will need to open Edge and navigate to Settings Profiles Passwords. There you should find an autofill toggle and another option to save new passwords to your account.
Firstly, check out our advice on selecting and using password managers. There are many services – paid and free – out there and options to consider.
Now to export your Authenticator passwords, open the app on your device then navigate to Settings Export Passwords. This will spit out an exported file containing your data.
Most of the password managers out there – including those built into other browsers, or Apple and Android’s own key ring apps – will have an import option, which should accept this file. If you’re having difficulty with the import, it’s best to consult their customer service lines for help."

The Swedish fintech, which until now has focused on buy now, pay later services, will now be able to provide UK-based customers with debit cards and Klarna accounts.
Customers will be able to save and manage money in their accounts, top up their debit cards, shop and receive funds, and earn up to 10% cashback when they make purchases.
“This authorisation marks Klarna’s next big step in the UK — moving beyond flexible payments into everyday financial management,” said Abby Vickers, head of Klarna Financial Services UK.
“While traditional banks are still playing catch-up, Klarna is giving consumers a smarter way to spend — and now, to manage their finances too.”
Vickers added that the licence “lays the foundation for future product expansion, strengthening Klarna’s ambition to disrupt traditional retail banking as it becomes a true everyday spending and saving partner for consumers”.
The move sets Klarna up to compete with the likes of popular digital banks such as Revolut and Monzo.
Following Brexit, Klarna Bank AB, a fully licensed Swedish bank, continued to provide regulated services in the UK under the FCA’s Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR). In 2023, the fintech then established a new, UK-based entity to provide all consumer-facing services in the UK.
Klarna is currently preparing a New York IPO, its second attempt to list after its first launch was delayed by market turmoil linked to President Trump’s trade war.
The shift away from its buy now, pay later focus has intensified since the postponement.
Klarna is seeking to boost investor sentiment after recording a loss of $99mn (€85.7mn) in the first quarter of 2025, significantly more than the $47mn (€40.7mn) loss reported a year earlier.
Customer credit losses also rose by 17% year-on-year. This means that more customers failed to repay Klarna what they owed, raising doubts about the sustainability of the firm’s business model.
The Swedish fintech hit a peak valuation of around $46bn (€39.8bn) in 2021 after a funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank. The company then lost around 85% of its valuation in 2022 as it struggled with a period of high interest rates, prompting major job cuts.
The fintech has held a banking licence in Sweden since 2017, and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has previously said the company is considering a US banking licence."

Von der Leyen and US President Donald Trump struck a tentative trade deal to avert a potentially devastating tariff war between two of the world's largest economies on Sunday. The majority of EU exports bound for the US will be subject to a 15% tariff.
According to a statement made by von der Leyen, this also includes billions of euros in EU investments in the US, as well as the purchase of defence equipment.
Tariffs of 15% will now apply to car exports to the US, compared to the previously announced 25%. Import duties on steel are to remain unchanged at 50%.
The German economy can breathe a sigh of relief for the time being, according to Managing Director of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce Helena Melnikov.
Melnikov said that worse has been prevented, however, ""the deal has its price, and this price is also at the expense of the German and European economies.""
Wolfgang Niedermark from the Federation of German Industries was more critical. He stated that even a tariff rate of 15% would have an ""immense negative impact"" on Germany's export-oriented industry.
The Federal Association of Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Service also spoke of a ""painful compromise"" and warned that supply chains would change and prices would rise, saying the deal will cost Germany growth, prosperity and jobs.
Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who was satisfied with Sunday's agreement, wrote on X that the deal showed it was possible to ""avert a trade conflict"".
However, a review of Trump's actions to date raises doubts about the reliability of the agreement and the US president's words.
In an interview with the Funke media group, Michael Hüther, director of the Institute for the German Economy, said that concerns remained as Trump had never completely taken tariff threats off the table."

Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the Fed’s reluctance to cut interest rates, which would boost the economy through cheaper loans poured into investments and spending.
However, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to do so, with the Chair Jerome Powell citing the looming inflation threat due to the US tariffs.
As the Fed is intended to be an independent agency, the Supreme Court has signalled that the president can't fire Powell just because he won't cut rates as fast as Trump wants.
Trump also recently said he considered firing the Fed Chair, but said he is 'highly unlikely' to do so. However, he also suggested that the escalating construction could serve as a reason to fire Powell.
On Thursday, Trump scorned Powell over costs as they toured the Federal Reserve building's renovation. But as the president pulled out a paper to show an increased amount, the Fed Chair had to correct him. The scene ended with the president joking that he would back off Powell if he lowered interest rates, according to Associated Press.
Watch the video above to see how Powell reacted to President Trump's words about the cost of the renovation."

Germany, the bloc’s economic powerhouse, fell back into contraction territory, while Spain continued to outpace its peers.
According to the preliminary flash estimate released on Wednesday, seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.1% in the eurozone and by 0.2% in the European Union in the second quarter of 2025, compared with the previous quarter.
While the reading slightly surpassed economist expectations of a flat growth rate, this marks a notable deceleration from the 0.6% and 0.5% expansions seen in the eurozone and EU respectively in the first quarter.
Year-on-year, growth also eased a little, with the eurozone up 1.4% and the EU up 1.5%, both slightly below the pace seen earlier in 2025.
""Although the slowdown is to a large extent a by-product of a misleadingly healthy Q1 number, broad-based weakness across national data indicates that the economy lacks momentum, with only a handful of countries blowing into its sails,"" said Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
The slowdown wasn’t uniform across the continent.
Spain stood out with the strongest quarterly growth at 0.7%, thanks to solid consumer spending, a rebound in business investment, and rising exports.
""Spain is in another league, showing stubbornly robust dynamism. The moderate Q2 decline in Irish GDP suggests that there is ample room for further correction,"" Marcelli Fabiani added.
Portugal and Estonia also delivered solid results, expanding by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.
On the other hand, Germany shrank by 0.1%, ending a run of modest growth. It marked the country’s first contraction since mid-2024.
The decline was mainly due to weaker investment in machinery and construction, although household and government spending still offered some support.
Italy’s GDP contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter, reversing the 0.3% gain recorded in the first quarter and defying market expectations of a 0.2% increase. It was the country’s first contraction since Q2 2023, reflecting weak domestic demand and softening industrial activity.
There was some good news from France, where the economy picked up more than expected. GDP rose 0.3% — the best result in nearly a year — helped by stronger domestic demand.
Yet Oxford Economics remains cautious, noting that France’s expansion paints an overly rosy picture, driven largely by stockbuilding, while both domestic demand and net trade actually dragged on GDP.
Financial markets responded calmly to the data, with eurozone assets stabilising following recent volatility tied to the US-EU trade deal, which analysts broadly view as tilting in Washington’s favour over Brussels.
The euro was steady at $1.1550, recovering slightly after enduring its worst two-day drop since February 2023.
The EURO STOXX 50 index edged 0.1% higher, while the broader EURO STOXX 600 was flat.
French consumer staples were among the top performers, with Danone rising 6.7% and L’Oréal up 4% after reporting strong quarterly earnings boosted by Chinese demand.
Nokia also rallied 5.4%. In contrast, Adidas fell over 6% following a revenue miss and a profit warning, while Mercedes-Benz Group dropped 1% after reporting a halving of its first-half profits and cutting its full-year revenue forecast below last year’s €146 billion.
Germany’s DAX index was unchanged at 24,200 points, about two percentage points below its all-time high, while Italy’s FTSE MIB climbed 0.3% to 41,350 points, its highest since July 2007 and eyeing its ninth positive session in the last ten."

So much so that the photogenic success of this floral backdrop has become unmanageable for one Spanish community.
The town of Brihuega in the province of Guadalajara draws hundreds of thousands of tourists annually to its lavender fields.
With so many visitors descending on the attraction at the weekend during blooming season, local authorities are now mulling how to reduce the impact of tourists on residents.
Brihuega has around 1,000 hectares of lavender fields that social media users have discovered provide an ideal backdrop for Instagram photography.
Thanks to thissocial mediaboom, the destination has gained significant popularity over the last 10 years, with tourism helping to reverse population decline in the rural community.
The town has experienced a 24 per cent growth in population and has seen millions of euros flow into the local economy.
But the tables have now turned, asincreasing numbers of visitorsarrive in Brihuega, creating an overwhelming demand on the town’s local infrastructure.
Over 100,000 people descended on the fields during July, the month when the lavender reaches full bloom, putting immense pressure on the nearby community of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants.
Although local authorities acknowledge the lavender fields' crucial economic importance, Mayor Lusi Viejo has appealed to tourists to consider avoiding weekend visits.
“Take last Saturday, for example: the village collapsed. It was a hard time for me,” Mr Viejo told the Spanish national daily newspaper ABC.
“We have a wide range of tourist, cultural and artistic offerings thanks to the lavender,” he said.
“But my advice is that people come and visit us between Monday and Thursday – please! Weekends are more difficult because of the huge quantity of people who come.”
The main issue, particularly during the season when the lavender is in bloom, is visitors clogging Brihuega's historic narrow lanes and parking vehicles haphazardly.
""Ahead of next year, we need to build a park-and-ride parking lot on the outskirts of the historic centre and connect it with shuttle buses,"" Viejo said.
In a recent communication to local residents, Viejo announced plans for a permanent park-and-ride system with connecting shuttle services.
The mayor also noted that field access remains free, preventing the municipality from controlling visitor numbers or implementingtourism taxes.
Despite challenges from excessive crowds, the substantial tourist numbers have contributed €8m to the regional economy throughout this lavender season.
""Managing such an influx of visitors in such a short time is difficult. We work hard, we have a security committee, but it’s still a large turnout,"" the mayor said.
He added that the goal is to attract year-roundtourismand distribute visitors more evenly, rather than experiencing concentrations during the lavender blooming season.
Brihuega’s mayor highlighted the council's efforts to promote visits to the area’s sumac fields during October and November, when the slopes are transformed by the deep red flowers."

Deutsche Bank Research Institute's ‘Grocery Index’ reveals where a typical shopping basket is most expensive across European cities in 2025.
Based on data from Numbeo, the index compares grocery costs in major cities across the world, including many in Europe. It is calculated using weighted prices of everyday grocery items, including milk, bread, eggs, fruits and meat from Numbeo's ‘Markets’ data. Each city is given a score, where the base line for comparison is New York, which is set at 100. It does not account for purchasing power, which is an important factor when comparing cities.
So, which cities have the highest grocery costs in Europe? And where is the cheapest place to do your weekly shop?
Part of the Mapping the World’s Prices report, Geneva tops the Grocery Index as the most expensive city globally. Its index score is 106, meaning grocery prices are 6% higher than in New York. For comparison, that means a basket that costs €100 in New York would cost €106 in Geneva.
Another Swiss city, Zurich, ranks as the second most expensive in Europe with a score of 103.
These are the only European cities that are more expensive than New York, which is used as the base in the index.
All five US cities included in the Grocery Index (San Francisco, New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles) are more expensive than every European city—except for Geneva and Zurich. San Francisco also ranks above New York, with a score of 104.
The next three most expensive cities in Europe are Oslo (78), Paris (71), and Luxembourg (66). While they are significantly cheaper than both New York and the Swiss cities, they still make up the top five in Europe.
Many European cities have grocery price scores between 58 and 63, which can be considered mid-range. They included: Helsinki (63), Vienna (63), Copenhagen (63), Milan (62), London (62), Brussels (61), Edinburgh (61), Frankfurt (58), Dublin (58), Amsterdam (58), Munich (58), and Stockholm (58).
The cheapest group includes cities with index scores of 55 and below. Among them, Budapest and Warsaw (both scoring 37) are the cheapest European cities on the list. This means a grocery basket that costs €100 in New York would cost just €37 in the capitals of Hungary and Poland. That’s 63% cheaper than the New York baseline.
Other cities with the lowest grocery price scores include Istanbul (39), Prague (42), Lisbon (44), Athens (46), Madrid (46), Barcelona (49), Rome (51), Birmingham (51), and Berlin (55).
Not surprisingly, the index also reveals significant price differences between cities within the same country. For example, the score is 62 in London compared to 51 in Birmingham.
Globally, Cairo has the lowest score at just 20 points. This means the grocery basket in New York costs five times that of Cairo.
Among the capital cities of the top five European economies, France is the most expensive and Spain the cheapest in terms of grocery prices. Their index scores are: Paris (71), London (62), Berlin (55), Rome (51), and Madrid (46).
This means that while a grocery basket costs €71 in Paris, the same basket is only €46 in Madrid. This makes the French capital 54% more expensive than the Spanish capital.
Paris is also significantly more expensive than Rome (by 39%) and Berlin (by 29%). Compared to London, the difference is smaller, with Paris being 15% more expensive.
Grocery prices on Numbeo, whereDeutsche Banksourced its data, are listed in euros. However, they are not directly comparable to the index, as it is weighted, and the specific items and their quantities used in the calculation are not disclosed.
According to Numbeo’s July 2025 data, based on the total cost of 19 common grocery items in the markets section, Paris remains the most expensive city among Europe’s top economies. The total comes to €107.20 in Paris, followed by €89.54 in London, €82.10 in Berlin, and €79.60 in Rome. Madrid continues to offer the cheapest grocery prices at €72.70."

Damage was reported and evacuations were issued in Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, the quake’s epicentre. A tsunami of up to 4 metres was reported in parts of the region, the regional minister for emergency situation Sergei Lebedev said.
The quake caused damage to buildings and cars swayed in the streets in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which also had power outages and mobile phone service failures. Russian news agencies quoting the regional Health Ministry said several people sought medical help in Kamchatka after the earthquake, but no serious injuries were reported.
People were advised to move to higher ground around much of the Pacific coast. They were warned that the potential danger posed by a tsunami could last over a day. Most places where tsunami waves have already hit have reported no significant damage so far.
The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, according to US and Japanese seismologists. However, the US Geological Survey later updated its measurement to 8.8 magnitude and said it occurred at a depth of 20.7km.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre warned that waves of 1 to 3 metres above the tidal level may occur in some coastal areas of Hawaii, Chile, Japan and the Solomon Islands.
In some coastal areas of Russia and Ecuador, waves of more than 3 metres may occur.
The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for the Pacific coast of Japan and stated that waves of up to 3 metres could reach the coast of northern Japan.
""Urgent action must be taken to ensure the safety of life and property,"" the warning said. It was stated that the first waves were expected around 7 pm local time on Tuesday.
The Alaska-based National Tsunami Warning Centre issued a tsunami warning for parts of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, while parts of the West Coast, including California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, were also under caution.
Tsunami warning coordinator Dave Snider with the National Tsunami Warning Centre in Alaska said the impact of the tsunami could last for hours or perhaps more than a day.
“A tsunami is not just one wave,” he said. “It’s a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour - as fast as a jet airplane - in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that’s where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.”
“In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they’re going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,” which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.
Wednesday's earthquake is one of the world's strongest since a 2011 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan sent a massive tsunami which set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant.
Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measures around the world.
Japanese nuclear power plants have reported no abnormalities following the earthquake off of Russia. Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant said around 4,000 workers were taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.
It was the strongest earthquake to hit the Kamchatka Peninsula since 1952, when a 9.0 quake caused damage but no reported deaths despite setting off 9.1 metre waves in Hawaii.
In early July, five strong earthquakes occurred near Kamchatka, the strongest had a 7.4-magnitude. The largest earthquake was 20 kilometres deep and occurred 144 kilometres east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000."
